# ht-0lo implementation plan

Upgrade-aware discovery refinement: see [upgrade-discovery-refinement.md](upgrade-discovery-refinement.md). Task5/Task7 authorized refinement sections supersede historical copied formula text when H>0; original two-class formula remains applicable when H=0 under its stated snapshots. Ordinal mappings and existing historical bead snapshots remain unchanged.

Durable plan and progress ledger live in this run directory by caller override. Scratch briefs/review packages use `.superpowers/sdd/ht-0lo-plan/`, anchored by the unmodified SDD scripts. Parent owns final readiness and finish; no source implementation is part of materialization.

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Message deadline contract

For every new durable ACK-required ordinary send, freeze the duration using existing validation/default configuration and set its original deadline to canonical committed send time plus that duration. This applies to every recipient, including no binding, managed-launch/unregistered binding, unavailable binding and pending invitation. Availability never changes the original start/deadline, and cannot reset it on registration, accept, restart, or rebind. Lazy messages and human receipt waivers remain free of ACK obligations. Receipt still means receipt only.

The effective receipt projection, manifest preparation, sparse physical materialization, due cursors, soft-poke calculations and wake paths must agree. Keep availability separately meaningful: setting a deadline is not permission to wake, nor evidence of a live harness. Do not pretend send time is observed availability. Existing structural/native execution launch guards and wake harness/empty-composer guards remain mandatory.

Upgrade outstanding pending ACK-required messages too: preserve every previously running deadline, but give formerly dormant obligations the deadline derived from their immutable message send time and frozen duration. Already expired rows become due on the normal bounded scan. Preserve terminal states, receipt provenance and warning identities. A transactionally recorded schema/semantics marker makes old and new manifest/physical projections consistent; materialize/index due work so unavailable recipients are actually discoverable, not merely capable of returning a deadline on individual lookup. Do not rewrite immutable requests or old result digests.

Existing explicit summary catch-up extensions in TRUST-POLICY A6 remain separate and visible; this redesign removes availability-based deferral, not the policy's bounded progress-based extension. Tests distinguish original deadline from an explicitly extended effective deadline. Warning delivery to the originating seat is durable even if it later leaves the thread; joined observers may retain existing warning visibility. An overdue warning says confirmation missed its deadline, never why. The original sender's open warning is waking attention under the existing composer/host/mod admission guards, even if the sender is no longer joined; clear remains passive and observer visibility is unchanged. For non-seat service authors preserve existing service reporting rather than inventing a sender seat. Update TRUST-POLICY A7 to record this narrow new waking recipient rule. Native wake can be deferred by a draft, active turn or unavailable host; the durable warning remains pending, so bounded deadline detection does not promise bounded native key submission. Late ACK clears the existing warning through normal lifecycle without retroactively changing the deadline.

#### Confirmed roast refinements

Healthy-daemon discovery contract: retain the5,000ms safety tick and100candidate per-drive cap; continue immediately while successful due progress reports more. Each class advances a stable finite high-water cursor fairly; newly arriving obligations do not restart/starve the current snapshot. Native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. For a snapshot with at most N candidates per class and successful runnable driver quanta taking at most Q ms including storage/scheduling, durable pending-warning detection finishes within5,000ms +(2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q; this is conditional on the daemon running and successful bounded storage, not a guarantee across outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload or native key submission. Restart resumes/reconstructs fair discovery and scans already overdue obligations. Early fake-clock tests use at least250candidates in EACH invitation and receipt class, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing arrivals and restart; verify every initial overdue row is warned within the formula and arrivals cannot starve either class. Historical upgrade also uses multiple bounded batches without losing overdue indexed discovery.

Receipt semantic capability: advertise messages.send_time_receipts_v1 only when canonical send-time projection and its ordinary send handlers are active. Modern clients require this capability before every new ACK-required ordinary send or handoff durable/native effect; absent/refused discovery produces explicit unsupported-daemon error, with no silent legacy fallback. All CLI entry paths and service-capable client sends that promise this contract are covered. Old clients talking to an upgraded daemon receive canonical new-send semantics without modifying their old wire requests. Lazy/human-waived sends remain exempt; completed retained keyed historical operations remain inspectable/replayable with original bytes/digests/outcomes and are never rewritten. A pending historical retry on an unsupported daemon refuses before additional effects. Test newCLI/olddaemon refusal, oldCLI/newdaemon canonical send, current/current unbound sends and lazy/human exemptions using capability fixtures.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Add fake-clock store regressions covering new unbound, unavailable, unregistered and invited recipients, both sparse manifest and physical projections, and registration/acceptance/restart/rebind that cannot restart original deadlines. Distinguish explicit A6 catch-up extension; retain lazy and human waivers.
2. Change canonical projection and publication/materialization to derive original pending ACK deadlines from committed send timestamp and frozen duration, preserving already running deadlines and all terminal states/provenance. Keep observed availability independent.
3. Advertise messages.send_time_receipts_v1 only when handlers implement the new semantics. Require it before every new ACK-required ordinary send across actual CLI, retained pending retry, and service-capable client entry paths; completed historical replay remains unchanged. Add new/old client-daemon matrix tests and explicit unsupported/refused discovery no-effects assertions.
4. Run focused projection/materialization/send/capability tests and per-change format/clippy. Expose the capability string and canonical projection semantics to .1.3, .1.2 and .3.2.

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Invitation contract

Ordinary agent invitations default to Lazy: membership is pending and discoverable through existing inbox/hook opportunities, but the invitation itself requests no timed confirmation or native wake. Add invitation `--require-ack` and optional `--deadline SECONDS`; explicit deadline implies require-ack for ergonomic compatibility, and `--lazy` conflicts with either. An ACK-required invitation starts its acceptance deadline at canonical invitation creation. Only explicit recipient acceptance settles it automatically; no separate invitation ACK command and no registration settlement. Expiry notifies its originating seat with invitation deadline missed, regardless of failure to register or accept. The inviter's open warning is waking attention under existing safe composer/host/mod guards even after leaving; clear remains passive and existing debtor/observer visibility remains. Originator attribution is frozen from the original invitation episode, never inferred from a current member or a later duplicate caller. Rejection/cancellation/retirement retain existing truthful terminal outcomes and attributed rejection notices; lazy does not suppress explicit rejection notices.

Existing required service memberships and explicit human/operator invitation semantics remain unchanged. Existing ordinary pending invitations retain their current timed obligation; historical retry with omitted new fields retains its original interpretation. Use an additive optional delivery/confirmation field whose absence denotes legacy timed behavior; modern CLI explicitly emits Lazy for the new default. Persist requested timing and original inviter attribution independently of joined membership. Pending-invite duplicate calls return the existing invitation without silently upgrading/downgrading its deadline or waking it; changing obligation policy requires a new episode through existing disposition flow. Already joined is still AlreadyJoined, never a new obligation. Existing human mode cannot manufacture an agent ACK requirement.

Queries, inbox compact/machine/JSON, digest, mod/native wake selection and due scans all honor the requested mode. Lazy presentation is bookkeeping only. ACK-required invitation attention remains ordinary guarded delivery; accept remains an accountable recipient choice. Add schema fields/index predicate changes conservatively and negotiate protocol capability/version before any mutation requiring the new representation. Older saved intent bytes/digests are preserved and replayed unchanged; unsupported daemon refuses new semantics before writing.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Write serialization fixtures proving omitted confirmation field retains exactly historical request bytes/digests and legacy timed meaning; explicit modern Lazy and timed requests round-trip distinctly. Define additive optional mode plus frozen timing and original inviter schema/index representation.
2. Add conservative schema migration and capability advertisement/refusal for the new representation. Preserve required/operator/human membership semantics and legacy pending invitations. Update only mechanical Invite struct literal construction in existing source/tests as required to keep all targets compiling; pass legacy absence in historical callers, without prematurely selecting modern defaults.
3. Test supported and unsupported capability negotiation before new representation effects; schema restart and original inviter/timing persistence. Document exact new wire type/field/capability for .2.2, .2.3 and .3.2.
4. Run focused protocol/schema compatibility tests, cargo fmt and required clippy. Do not implement the lifecycle or modern CLI default assigned to later leaves.

### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Stable hook entrypoints and ownership

Expose `herdr-threads hook-event HARNESS EVENT` as the dedicated stable CLI surface; map each declared native event exactly to its registered codec/handler. Keep existing `hook HARNESS --event EVENT` syntax working for old registrations. Reject invalid harness/event pairs before daemon effects. A given executable spelling plus canonical state-dir/host-endpoint plus harness/event yields byte-identical shell command across reinstalls. Routing selectors remain pinned where required; different installations/routes must not silently collapse.

Remove the per-install UUID shell comment from newly generated command strings, not the manifest installation identity. Persist exact installed groups/fingerprints and installation ID in ownership records. Existing unmanaged identical groups are foreign: do not adopt, overwrite, remove or treat them as owned without the existing explicit adoption path. Conflicting same-event registrations fail safely with actionable diagnostics. Reinstall reuses its existing exact owned group, retaining position to avoid unnecessary native trust-key shifts. Migrate legacy UUID-marked or shared-event owned groups only under explicit setup/doctor-fix intent, preserving unrelated groups/keys and interrupted-update recovery. Unsetup removes only exactly owned records; drift fails safely. No automatic edit of native trust records, hooks.state, or permission grants. Update status/trust reporting to compare each event's actual stable command rather than infer one shared string. Never silently rewrite real user configurations during development.

The Claude and Codex registrations get their declared per-event entrypoints. Hermes callback transport remains its existing fixed Python bridge; do not mechanically apply native shell grammar to it. Any bundled launch/mod prefix that currently consumes hook argv continues to obtain the canonical route rather than an event command. Registry manifests/canary expectations and embedded skill/help must agree with stable generated commands. TRUST-POLICY records invitation confirmation meaning and repaired receipt timer semantics; no new receipt provenance is needed for invitation acceptance.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

2. Implement dedicated CLI dispatch through existing registry/codecs and stable per-event shell command generation using executable spelling plus exact canonical route/harness/event. Remove random UUID shell suffix only from new command grammar; retain manifest install identity.
3. Keep Hermes Python transport and bundled Claude mod canonical route extraction compatible. Publish exact command-generation and route-extraction APIs for .4.2; preserve existing registrations until explicit migration owns their transition.
4. Run focused hook/entrypoint/setup command grammar tests and format/clippy, including repeat identical spelling and different route separation.

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Durable handoff interface and recovery

Support exactly one instruction source: the legacy quoted positional body after `--`, `--file PATH`, or `--stdin`. Read once before any durable effect, require nonempty valid UTF-8 within 65,536 bytes, preserve exact content/newlines, bound input while reading, and freeze actual bytes into the compound intent. Retrying never rereads a file/stdin or native environment options. Keep topic/goal validation separate. Reuse src/cli/input.rs normal message source validation; body validation is nonempty valid UTF-8, not bounded_text's unrelated topic/identifier trim or NUL restrictions. The source bytes and their JSON escaping are preserved exactly. All three modes (new-tab, explicit empty-pane launch, existing-recipient delivery) use the same body/deadline contract and exact keys.

Handoff always sends an ACK-required addressed instructions message, defaulting to the existing receipt-duration setting; add `--deadline SECONDS` to override that message deadline, frozen before staging. Its invitation is lazy unless the caller explicitly requests `--require-invite-ack`; add `--invite-deadline SECONDS` to imply that option. Message and invitation deadlines are independent. Stage messages while invitation is pending; sender already joined is required. Carry policy through all public request, preparation, canonical bootstrap, legacy handoff, existing delivery and retained retry representations. Omitted new fields in historical intents preserve historical child requests/digests. No restaging of completed child mutations or automatic launch after possible-start.

Raise only body-bearing retained envelope ceilings conservatively: canonical bootstrap identity and request-bearing local bootstrap progress from128KiB to512KiB; recovery from256KiB to1MiB. Keep metadata-only creation/attachment128KiB, completed2MiB and global wire1MiB unless the actual serializer's supported worst-case fixtures demonstrate a required narrowly scoped adjustment. Six JSON bytes per input byte means a65,536-byte body consumes393,216 encoded bytes per occurrence; inventory every duplicated body and nested serialized original rather than assuming one occurrence. The handoff source task owns actual encoded-bound calculation/tests across public wire, canonical identity/recovery/completion, local progress/linked/terminal/origin snapshots and replay. Test maximum ordinary text, maximum six-byte-escaped UTF-8 body and source mutations through each public handoff path; all supported body values under ordinary bounded metadata must stage and survive retry. Exact serialized capacity checks occur before durable effects; independent oversized metadata/native response limits still fail honestly without truncation or reclassification. Update TRUST-POLICY encoded-limit documentation in the implementation commit and preserve historical bytes/keys/digests. No unconditional global frame increase or unbounded reads.

Native startup contains only fixed inbox instructions, exact canonical routing metadata and pinned fallback. It contains no task body, body path or arbitrary task argv. Compare all three routing fields before preferring hook commands. Existing launched agents with changing harness versions still recover instructions from durable inbox; setup diagnostics/trust refusals do not discard them. Hook/setup/profile readiness inspection is diagnostic and does not block staging or an otherwise safe guarded launch: observed hook installation/trust cannot establish delivery, and a wrong inherited profile must not veto launching a user-selected native harness. Retain exact empty-shell/seat/caller/native argv safety guards; fingerprint-recheck any owned launch configuration actually used, but absence of owned hook configuration is not a veto and never gets a fabricated fingerprint. Unsupported environment overrides and native host-kind/grammar capabilities remain safety refusals; native harness approval/configuration refusals remain truthful refusals, never automatically answered. ACK or overdue warning confirms the bounded handoff outcome, independent of advisory setup status. Launch success is not registration, acceptance, receipt or task adoption. On missed confirmation the sender inspects and recovers; trust/approval remains user consent, never automatic.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Add exactly-one-source positional/file/stdin parser/acquisition tests at empty/invalid UTF-8/65,536/65,537 byte boundaries; preserve whitespace, NUL and newlines as ordinary message bytes. Reuse bounded src/cli/input.rs acquisition; keep topic/goal checks separate.
2. Freeze actual acquired bytes once in every compound handoff intent. Test mutate/delete file and unavailable stdin after staging, then replay with original body and unchanged keyed identities. Native argv contains only fixed inbox/routing, no body/path.
3. Inventory body duplication and nested escaping across public wire/canonical identity/recovery/completion/local progress/linked/terminal/origin snapshots. Exercise actual serializer worst-case six-byte escape 64KiB fixtures through all three paths; preflight encoded limits before effects. Raise only approved body-bearing bounds, with narrowly justified exceptions supported by fixtures; preserve historical bytes/digests.
4. Update TRUST-POLICY encoded-limit clauses in this same change. Run focused parser/journal/topology retained-retry tests and format/clippy. Export frozen payload shapes to .3.2.

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Message deadline contract

For every new durable ACK-required ordinary send, freeze the duration using existing validation/default configuration and set its original deadline to canonical committed send time plus that duration. This applies to every recipient, including no binding, managed-launch/unregistered binding, unavailable binding and pending invitation. Availability never changes the original start/deadline, and cannot reset it on registration, accept, restart, or rebind. Lazy messages and human receipt waivers remain free of ACK obligations. Receipt still means receipt only.

The effective receipt projection, manifest preparation, sparse physical materialization, due cursors, soft-poke calculations and wake paths must agree. Keep availability separately meaningful: setting a deadline is not permission to wake, nor evidence of a live harness. Do not pretend send time is observed availability. Existing structural/native execution launch guards and wake harness/empty-composer guards remain mandatory.

Upgrade outstanding pending ACK-required messages too: preserve every previously running deadline, but give formerly dormant obligations the deadline derived from their immutable message send time and frozen duration. Already expired rows become due on the normal bounded scan. Preserve terminal states, receipt provenance and warning identities. A transactionally recorded schema/semantics marker makes old and new manifest/physical projections consistent; materialize/index due work so unavailable recipients are actually discoverable, not merely capable of returning a deadline on individual lookup. Do not rewrite immutable requests or old result digests.

Existing explicit summary catch-up extensions in TRUST-POLICY A6 remain separate and visible; this redesign removes availability-based deferral, not the policy's bounded progress-based extension. Tests distinguish original deadline from an explicitly extended effective deadline. Warning delivery to the originating seat is durable even if it later leaves the thread; joined observers may retain existing warning visibility. An overdue warning says confirmation missed its deadline, never why. The original sender's open warning is waking attention under the existing composer/host/mod admission guards, even if the sender is no longer joined; clear remains passive and observer visibility is unchanged. For non-seat service authors preserve existing service reporting rather than inventing a sender seat. Update TRUST-POLICY A7 to record this narrow new waking recipient rule. Native wake can be deferred by a draft, active turn or unavailable host; the durable warning remains pending, so bounded deadline detection does not promise bounded native key submission. Late ACK clears the existing warning through normal lifecycle without retroactively changing the deadline.

#### Confirmed roast refinements

Healthy-daemon discovery contract: retain the5,000ms safety tick and100candidate per-drive cap; continue immediately while successful due progress reports more. Each class advances a stable finite high-water cursor fairly; newly arriving obligations do not restart/starve the current snapshot. Native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. For a snapshot with at most N candidates per class and successful runnable driver quanta taking at most Q ms including storage/scheduling, durable pending-warning detection finishes within5,000ms +(2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q; this is conditional on the daemon running and successful bounded storage, not a guarantee across outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload or native key submission. Restart resumes/reconstructs fair discovery and scans already overdue obligations. Early fake-clock tests use at least250candidates in EACH invitation and receipt class, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing arrivals and restart; verify every initial overdue row is warned within the formula and arrivals cannot starve either class. Historical upgrade also uses multiple bounded batches without losing overdue indexed discovery.

Receipt semantic capability: advertise messages.send_time_receipts_v1 only when canonical send-time projection and its ordinary send handlers are active. Modern clients require this capability before every new ACK-required ordinary send or handoff durable/native effect; absent/refused discovery produces explicit unsupported-daemon error, with no silent legacy fallback. All CLI entry paths and service-capable client sends that promise this contract are covered. Old clients talking to an upgraded daemon receive canonical new-send semantics without modifying their old wire requests. Lazy/human-waived sends remain exempt; completed retained keyed historical operations remain inspectable/replayable with original bytes/digests/outcomes and are never rewritten. A pending historical retry on an unsupported daemon refuses before additional effects. Test newCLI/olddaemon refusal, oldCLI/newdaemon canonical send, current/current unbound sends and lazy/human exemptions using capability fixtures.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Construct historical physical and manifest pending obligations with dormant timers, existing running deadlines, terminal/waived receipts and immutable retained request/result digests.
2. Implement transactional idempotent semantics marker/backfill so dormant obligations derive deadline from immutable send timestamp/frozen duration while all running and terminal values remain unchanged. Ensure sparse/materialized due indexes expose overdue rows.
3. Test multiple 100-candidate upgrade batches, restart/replay and continuing arrivals; prove no original overdue row disappears. Discovery scheduling belongs to .1.2 and consumes this landed indexed representation.
4. Run focused migration/effective/materialization tests and format/clippy; record marker and indexed discovery contract for .1.2.


### Authorized upgrade-aware acceptance refinement (supersedes prior formula)

Healthy-daemon discovery retains the 5,000ms safety tick and 100 actually inspected candidates per successful global due-driver quantum. Every two successful runnable global quanta give each unfinished receipt/invitation class one turn with a 100-candidate allowance; successful `more` continues immediately. All queries enforce finite captured high-water bounds before LIMIT, advance stable cursors, and count inspected rows even if future, terminal, waived or otherwise ineffective. Ordinary receipt scanning lends unused physical/sparse allowance so a non-final snapshot turn can consume its full allowance; native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. The 100 limit is a total row-inspection allowance, not 100 repaired rows plus 100 due rows.

During unfinished historical receipt repair, reserve at most ceil(limit/2) candidates for repair and the remaining allowance for ordinary due discovery (at least 50 at limit=100); lend unused repair allowance to due discovery. Advance persistent finite physical/prepared ordinal repair cursors without restarting ordinary due traversal every batch. Inspect each captured repair candidate at most once; published projection alone is repaired, while any physically visited unpublished prepared candidate still counts. Repair completion emits a one-shot `completed` transition and resets the ordinary receipt cursor before due selection in that same committed transaction. Repair progress, that completion/reset decision and due-warning effects commit or roll back together. This fresh post-repair traversal catches repaired deadlines behind a previously advanced due cursor. Empty repair finalization uses zero row allowance and shares the ordinary turn at full capacity. Failed decisions cannot consume the completion transition. Standalone backfill callers retaining a due cursor must honor `completed` too.

Bound definitions: start at a fresh paired discovery cycle with the target obligations already overdue, or restart with reconstructed finite cursors. H is an upper bound on ALL actually inspected candidates in the captured historical physical/prepared repair workload, including future/terminal/waived/unpublished candidates; it is not the number changed. D bounds ALL inspected ordinary receipt candidates in the complete fresh post-repair snapshot, including repaired rows, duplicate physical/sparse projections and finite arrivals captured before that snapshot freezes. I bounds ALL inspected invitation candidates in its initial finite snapshot, including future or subsequently ineffective rows. Q bounds elapsed time of one successful runnable GLOBAL driver quantum, including storage, scheduling and other admitted work. Later insertions outside captured high waters cannot enter or restart those walks, even when their deadlines are earlier. A finite D bound must cover any arrivals before the post-repair snapshot freezes; unbounded arrivals during repair do not justify using only the initial receipt count.

When H=0, empty repair bookkeeping completes within the first ordinary turn without reducing its capacity. With D and I at most N, the original two-class bound remains 5,000ms + (2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q. For H>0, set R=ceil(H/50)+2: the extra two receipt turns conservatively cover finite-stream/end probes and repair completion. After those R receipt turns, at most ceil(D/100)+1 further receipt turns finish the fresh post-repair snapshot; the +1 covers a full final page's empty completion. Invitations need at most ceil(I/100)+1 invitation turns. Fair alternation therefore gives the conservative GLOBAL bound:

`5,000ms + 2*max(R + ceil(D/100)+1, ceil(I/100)+1)*Q` for H>0.

The bound concerns durable warning detection for still-pending, unextended target obligations, not bounded native key submission. It is conditional on successful bounded storage/driver service, the stated finite workload/snapshot limits and Q; it does not cover outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload, newly expiring rows already passed by a snapshot cursor, or arbitrary arrivals outside the counted snapshots. Such rows belong to a subsequent fresh cycle. Restart resumes or reconstructs finite traversal without losing repair progress; a newly reconstructed traversal must count its inspected workload again. Tests must measure actual inspected work and global quanta, rather than changed rows or receipt-only calls.

Task5 verifies the producer locally: multiple batches, finite captured high waters, late earlier-deadline arrivals excluded from repair, mixed future/terminal/waived/unpublished candidates, all-terminal old backlog, one-shot atomic completion/reset, and rollback/restart. Task7 verifies the global conversion with at least 250 candidates in EACH receipt and invitation class, both H=0 and H>0, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing earlier-deadline arrivals, actual <=100 total inspections per quantum, immediate successful continuation, early ordinary-due progress before long repair exhaustion, final post-repair discovery and restart. Task7 owns normal due-query high-water enforcement/full allowance lending and shared fairness; Task5 does not claim the combined bound from receipt-only tests.

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Invitation contract

Ordinary agent invitations default to Lazy: membership is pending and discoverable through existing inbox/hook opportunities, but the invitation itself requests no timed confirmation or native wake. Add invitation `--require-ack` and optional `--deadline SECONDS`; explicit deadline implies require-ack for ergonomic compatibility, and `--lazy` conflicts with either. An ACK-required invitation starts its acceptance deadline at canonical invitation creation. Only explicit recipient acceptance settles it automatically; no separate invitation ACK command and no registration settlement. Expiry notifies its originating seat with invitation deadline missed, regardless of failure to register or accept. The inviter's open warning is waking attention under existing safe composer/host/mod guards even after leaving; clear remains passive and existing debtor/observer visibility remains. Originator attribution is frozen from the original invitation episode, never inferred from a current member or a later duplicate caller. Rejection/cancellation/retirement retain existing truthful terminal outcomes and attributed rejection notices; lazy does not suppress explicit rejection notices.

Existing required service memberships and explicit human/operator invitation semantics remain unchanged. Existing ordinary pending invitations retain their current timed obligation; historical retry with omitted new fields retains its original interpretation. Use an additive optional delivery/confirmation field whose absence denotes legacy timed behavior; modern CLI explicitly emits Lazy for the new default. Persist requested timing and original inviter attribution independently of joined membership. Pending-invite duplicate calls return the existing invitation without silently upgrading/downgrading its deadline or waking it; changing obligation policy requires a new episode through existing disposition flow. Already joined is still AlreadyJoined, never a new obligation. Existing human mode cannot manufacture an agent ACK requirement.

Queries, inbox compact/machine/JSON, digest, mod/native wake selection and due scans all honor the requested mode. Lazy presentation is bookkeeping only. ACK-required invitation attention remains ordinary guarded delivery; accept remains an accountable recipient choice. Add schema fields/index predicate changes conservatively and negotiate protocol capability/version before any mutation requiring the new representation. Older saved intent bytes/digests are preserved and replayed unchanged; unsupported daemon refuses new semantics before writing.

#### Confirmed roast refinements

Healthy-daemon discovery contract: retain the5,000ms safety tick and100candidate per-drive cap; continue immediately while successful due progress reports more. Each class advances a stable finite high-water cursor fairly; newly arriving obligations do not restart/starve the current snapshot. Native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. For a snapshot with at most N candidates per class and successful runnable driver quanta taking at most Q ms including storage/scheduling, durable pending-warning detection finishes within5,000ms +(2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q; this is conditional on the daemon running and successful bounded storage, not a guarantee across outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload or native key submission. Restart resumes/reconstructs fair discovery and scans already overdue obligations. Early fake-clock tests use at least250candidates in EACH invitation and receipt class, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing arrivals and restart; verify every initial overdue row is warned within the formula and arrivals cannot starve either class. Historical upgrade also uses multiple bounded batches without losing overdue indexed discovery.

Receipt semantic capability: advertise messages.send_time_receipts_v1 only when canonical send-time projection and its ordinary send handlers are active. Modern clients require this capability before every new ACK-required ordinary send or handoff durable/native effect; absent/refused discovery produces explicit unsupported-daemon error, with no silent legacy fallback. All CLI entry paths and service-capable client sends that promise this contract are covered. Old clients talking to an upgraded daemon receive canonical new-send semantics without modifying their old wire requests. Lazy/human-waived sends remain exempt; completed retained keyed historical operations remain inspectable/replayable with original bytes/digests/outcomes and are never rewritten. A pending historical retry on an unsupported daemon refuses before additional effects. Test newCLI/olddaemon refusal, oldCLI/newdaemon canonical send, current/current unbound sends and lazy/human exemptions using capability fixtures.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Add fake-clock lifecycle tests for lazy no-deadline/no-wake invitation; explicitly timed never-register and register-without-accept expiry; accept/late accept/reject/cancel/retire, original inviter leaving and duplicate callers trying to change timing/originator.
2. Implement canonical mode and frozen origin/timing through invitation create/duplicate/terminal/query/inbox/digest/mod/wake projections. Acceptance alone settles timed confirmation automatically; registration does not. Retain required and human/operator behavior and attributed lazy rejection notice.
3. Own invitation-class bounded high-water cursor/store API and isolated invitation due tests. Exclude lazy rows from due/wake selection; route original inviter open warning as guarded waking attention after leave, clear passively. Publish cursor/progress API for shared-driver owner .1.2; do not independently redesign shared scheduling.
4. Update TRUST-POLICY invitation/A7 clauses and run focused store lifecycle/due/wake/query tests plus format/clippy. Shared combined fairness acceptance remains in .1.2 and terminal sweep.

## Task 7: Due discovery and originating-seat warning lifecycle

bead: ht-0lo.1.2

Dependencies: ht-0lo.1.3, ht-0lo.1.1

Coordinator-added dependency: ht-0lo.2.2 supplies the invitation-class scanner consumed by shared fair due-driver tests. The canonical snapshot above predates this added edge.

### Acceptance criteria (verbatim)

Implement and run every scenario named in this description; preserve the parent spec contract. Focused tests, format and per-change clippy pass. Healthy-daemon discovery contract: retain the5,000ms safety tick and100candidate per-drive cap; continue immediately while successful due progress reports more. Each class advances a stable finite high-water cursor fairly; newly arriving obligations do not restart/starve the current snapshot. Native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. For a snapshot with at most N candidates per class and successful runnable driver quanta taking at most Q ms including storage/scheduling, durable pending-warning detection finishes within5,000ms +(2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q; this is conditional on the daemon running and successful bounded storage, not a guarantee across outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload or native key submission. Restart resumes/reconstructs fair discovery and scans already overdue obligations. Early fake-clock tests use at least250candidates in EACH invitation and receipt class, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing arrivals and restart; verify every initial overdue row is warned within the formula and arrivals cannot starve either class. Historical upgrade also uses multiple bounded batches without losing overdue indexed discovery.

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Message deadline contract

For every new durable ACK-required ordinary send, freeze the duration using existing validation/default configuration and set its original deadline to canonical committed send time plus that duration. This applies to every recipient, including no binding, managed-launch/unregistered binding, unavailable binding and pending invitation. Availability never changes the original start/deadline, and cannot reset it on registration, accept, restart, or rebind. Lazy messages and human receipt waivers remain free of ACK obligations. Receipt still means receipt only.

The effective receipt projection, manifest preparation, sparse physical materialization, due cursors, soft-poke calculations and wake paths must agree. Keep availability separately meaningful: setting a deadline is not permission to wake, nor evidence of a live harness. Do not pretend send time is observed availability. Existing structural/native execution launch guards and wake harness/empty-composer guards remain mandatory.

Upgrade outstanding pending ACK-required messages too: preserve every previously running deadline, but give formerly dormant obligations the deadline derived from their immutable message send time and frozen duration. Already expired rows become due on the normal bounded scan. Preserve terminal states, receipt provenance and warning identities. A transactionally recorded schema/semantics marker makes old and new manifest/physical projections consistent; materialize/index due work so unavailable recipients are actually discoverable, not merely capable of returning a deadline on individual lookup. Do not rewrite immutable requests or old result digests.

Existing explicit summary catch-up extensions in TRUST-POLICY A6 remain separate and visible; this redesign removes availability-based deferral, not the policy's bounded progress-based extension. Tests distinguish original deadline from an explicitly extended effective deadline. Warning delivery to the originating seat is durable even if it later leaves the thread; joined observers may retain existing warning visibility. An overdue warning says confirmation missed its deadline, never why. The original sender's open warning is waking attention under the existing composer/host/mod admission guards, even if the sender is no longer joined; clear remains passive and observer visibility is unchanged. For non-seat service authors preserve existing service reporting rather than inventing a sender seat. Update TRUST-POLICY A7 to record this narrow new waking recipient rule. Native wake can be deferred by a draft, active turn or unavailable host; the durable warning remains pending, so bounded deadline detection does not promise bounded native key submission. Late ACK clears the existing warning through normal lifecycle without retroactively changing the deadline.

#### Confirmed roast refinements

Healthy-daemon discovery contract: retain the5,000ms safety tick and100candidate per-drive cap; continue immediately while successful due progress reports more. Each class advances a stable finite high-water cursor fairly; newly arriving obligations do not restart/starve the current snapshot. Native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. For a snapshot with at most N candidates per class and successful runnable driver quanta taking at most Q ms including storage/scheduling, durable pending-warning detection finishes within5,000ms +(2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q; this is conditional on the daemon running and successful bounded storage, not a guarantee across outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload or native key submission. Restart resumes/reconstructs fair discovery and scans already overdue obligations. Early fake-clock tests use at least250candidates in EACH invitation and receipt class, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing arrivals and restart; verify every initial overdue row is warned within the formula and arrivals cannot starve either class. Historical upgrade also uses multiple bounded batches without losing overdue indexed discovery.

Receipt semantic capability: advertise messages.send_time_receipts_v1 only when canonical send-time projection and its ordinary send handlers are active. Modern clients require this capability before every new ACK-required ordinary send or handoff durable/native effect; absent/refused discovery produces explicit unsupported-daemon error, with no silent legacy fallback. All CLI entry paths and service-capable client sends that promise this contract are covered. Old clients talking to an upgraded daemon receive canonical new-send semantics without modifying their old wire requests. Lazy/human-waived sends remain exempt; completed retained keyed historical operations remain inspectable/replayable with original bytes/digests/outcomes and are never rewritten. A pending historical retry on an unsupported daemon refuses before additional effects. Test newCLI/olddaemon refusal, oldCLI/newdaemon canonical send, current/current unbound sends and lazy/human exemptions using capability fixtures.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Add expiry/late ACK tests for unbound, unavailable, managed-launch/unregistered and pending-invite recipients, sender leave, service authors and unavailable native wake due to drafts/working/host outage. Durable warning presence is separate from actual wake submission.
2. Implement bounded indexed receipt due discovery over upgraded sparse/physical rows and sender-addressed open/clear routing. Open warning wakes only original sender under existing guards; clear passive; do not invent a seat for service authors. Update TRUST-POLICY A7.
3. Own shared due driver/cursor scheduling and combined fake-clock fairness tests using .2.2 invitation-class store API. Keep 5,000ms safety tick and 100-candidate per-drive cap; successful continuation runs immediately and alternates classes over stable finite high-water snapshots. Test at least 250 candidates EACH, future/due mix, blocked wakes, continuing arrivals, restart and conditional detection bound 5,000ms +(2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q. Native wake completion cannot gate scanning.
4. Run focused receipt/poke/wake/scheduler tests and format/clippy; publish tested independent sender-warning lifecycle to .3.2.


### Authorized upgrade-aware acceptance refinement (supersedes prior formula)

Healthy-daemon discovery retains the 5,000ms safety tick and 100 actually inspected candidates per successful global due-driver quantum. Every two successful runnable global quanta give each unfinished receipt/invitation class one turn with a 100-candidate allowance; successful `more` continues immediately. All queries enforce finite captured high-water bounds before LIMIT, advance stable cursors, and count inspected rows even if future, terminal, waived or otherwise ineffective. Ordinary receipt scanning lends unused physical/sparse allowance so a non-final snapshot turn can consume its full allowance; native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. The 100 limit is a total row-inspection allowance, not 100 repaired rows plus 100 due rows.

During unfinished historical receipt repair, reserve at most ceil(limit/2) candidates for repair and the remaining allowance for ordinary due discovery (at least 50 at limit=100); lend unused repair allowance to due discovery. Advance persistent finite physical/prepared ordinal repair cursors without restarting ordinary due traversal every batch. Inspect each captured repair candidate at most once; published projection alone is repaired, while any physically visited unpublished prepared candidate still counts. Repair completion emits a one-shot `completed` transition and resets the ordinary receipt cursor before due selection in that same committed transaction. Repair progress, that completion/reset decision and due-warning effects commit or roll back together. This fresh post-repair traversal catches repaired deadlines behind a previously advanced due cursor. Empty repair finalization uses zero row allowance and shares the ordinary turn at full capacity. Failed decisions cannot consume the completion transition. Standalone backfill callers retaining a due cursor must honor `completed` too.

Bound definitions: start at a fresh paired discovery cycle with the target obligations already overdue, or restart with reconstructed finite cursors. H is an upper bound on ALL actually inspected candidates in the captured historical deadline-repair physical/prepared AND projection-bootstrap physical/sparse workload (counting duplicate visits separately), including future/terminal/waived/unpublished candidates; it is not the number changed. D bounds ALL inspected ordinary receipt candidates in the complete fresh post-repair snapshot, including repaired rows, duplicate physical/sparse projections and finite arrivals captured before that snapshot freezes. I bounds ALL inspected invitation candidates in its initial finite snapshot, including future or subsequently ineffective rows. Q bounds elapsed time of one successful runnable GLOBAL driver quantum, including storage, scheduling and other admitted work. Later insertions outside captured high waters cannot enter or restart those walks, even when their deadlines are earlier. A finite D bound must cover any arrivals before the post-repair snapshot freezes; unbounded arrivals during repair do not justify using only the initial receipt count.

When H=0, empty repair bookkeeping completes within the first ordinary turn without reducing its capacity. With D and I at most N, the original two-class bound remains 5,000ms + (2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q. For H>0, set R=ceil(H/50)+2: the extra two receipt turns conservatively cover finite-stream/end probes and repair completion. After those R receipt turns, at most ceil(D/100)+1 further receipt turns finish the fresh post-repair snapshot; the +1 covers a full final page's empty completion. Invitations need at most ceil(I/100)+1 invitation turns. Fair alternation therefore gives the conservative GLOBAL bound:

`5,000ms + 2*max(R + ceil(D/100)+1, ceil(I/100)+1)*Q` for H>0.

The bound concerns durable warning detection for still-pending, unextended target obligations, not bounded native key submission. It is conditional on successful bounded storage/driver service, the stated finite workload/snapshot limits and Q; it does not cover outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload, newly expiring rows already passed by a snapshot cursor, or arbitrary arrivals outside the counted snapshots. Such rows belong to a subsequent fresh cycle. Restart resumes or reconstructs finite traversal without losing repair progress; a newly reconstructed traversal must count its inspected workload again. Tests must measure actual inspected work and global quanta, rather than changed rows or receipt-only calls.

Task5 verifies the producer locally: multiple batches, finite captured high waters, late earlier-deadline arrivals excluded from repair, mixed future/terminal/waived/unpublished candidates, all-terminal old backlog, one-shot atomic completion/reset, and rollback/restart. Task7 verifies the global conversion with at least 250 candidates in EACH receipt and invitation class, both H=0 and H>0, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing earlier-deadline arrivals, actual <=100 total inspections per quantum, immediate successful continuation, early ordinary-due progress before long repair exhaustion, final post-repair discovery and restart. Task7 owns normal due-query high-water enforcement/full allowance lending and shared fairness; Task5 does not claim the combined bound from receipt-only tests.


### Authorized coalesced multi-originator warning acceptance refinement

Receipt-overdue warning conditions remain coalesced by their existing thread/recipient backlog identity. Preserve exactly one canonical open event for that condition, exact physical/manifest receipt-to-warning associations, and the existing final clear event. Never manufacture per-sender warning conditions/events or derive original senders from current thread membership, the warning event's first source message alone, or a later caller. Enumerate canonical original seat authors of ALL messages exactly associated with the coalesced warning via receipts/receipt_state.warning_message_id; retain existing service-author handling without inventing a seat.

For EACH canonical original sender of an exactly associated receipt, the still-open shared condition must participate in actual native waking-attention selection and mod/watch pending-set/fingerprint paths under existing admission guards, including a sender who left the thread. A successful test of notice-row insertion or inbox history alone is insufficient. A later receipt association from another original sender must become actionable even when it reuses an older open event and an informational notice-offer frontier has already passed that event's sequence. Do not conflate informational offer settlement with the canonical open-condition/associated-origin state. Preserve the existing per-occupant wake-offer deduplication and safe composer/host/harness admission: this refinement does not authorize repeated native submission for an unchanged already-offered actionable state, new receipt provenance, or a task-adoption/completion claim. Cross-path attention versions/fingerprints must represent newly actionable associations honestly rather than inventing a new canonical warning event.

Existing partial settlement semantics are verified in schema::clear_warning_conditions_for_receipts: the condition stays open while ANY exact associated receipt remains required/pending and not human-waived. ACK/waiver/terminal settlement of a subset must preserve all remaining origins' obligations and waking eligibility. Do not emit a condition clear, withdraw another origin's pending warning, or rewrite settled receipt/ACK provenance merely because the first event's source receipt settled. Historical informational delivery remains historical. Only settlement of the final required/pending/unwaived associated receipt clears the shared condition, once, through its existing passive-clear lifecycle; clears/observer notices create no waking attention. Routing preserves the backlog-wide open-condition lifetime; this refinement does not mandate quieting an individual sender after only its own receipts settle. All canonical associated original senders remain covered while the shared condition is open.

Task7 fixture/review requirements: construct at least TWO canonical original senders and THREE exact associated receipts sharing the same thread/recipient condition (for example A1,A2 from sender A and B1 from sender B), with at least one original sender leaving before warning routing. Exercise physical and published-manifest associations, mixed original authors and repeat scans. Prove exactly one open condition/event and all exact associations. Advance informational notice-offer frontiers, then coalesce a receipt from the other original sender; show actual native selection and mod/watch state/fingerprint expose the new origin under normal guards. Partially ACK A1 and prove A2/B1 origins remain actionable; settle A2 (the event's first origin now has no pending associated receipt) and prove B1 remains actionable without premature clear or extra open event. Finally settle B1 and prove one passive clear, no warning-only native/mod wake, unchanged exact ACK actor/generation/proof/history, and no synthetic receipt/adoption evidence. Per-occupant offer deduplication and blocking admission still apply independently to each origin. Existing H/D/I upgrade discovery bound refinement remains normative and unchanged.


### Required Task7 actual-discovery and shared early-gates acceptance refinement

For EVERY canonical original message sender in the coalesced-warning fixture, exercise the actual `discover_wake_candidates`/public wake-candidate discovery path before offer/load/reserve and native delivery; also exercise the real mod/watch path. Predicate-only `warning_wakes_seat`, direct attention calculation, hand-built WakeCandidate and direct reserve-only GREEN do not establish delivery/discovery. The fixture must leave original senders with the still-open condition as their sole waking source: settle informational offers, avoid unrelated pending invitation/receipt/notice rows masking discovery, include a sender who left, and coalesce messages from at least two canonical origins under one shared thread/recipient open warning. Verify actual discovery returns EACH original sender, then that downstream candidate/offer/load/reserve/native and mod fingerprints retain the open-origin work independently of informational notice frontiers. This must cover originators whose association is not the first warning event's source message. Existing per-occupant/reservation retry and native safety guards remain, but a generic informational `notice_frontier` or legacy warning-offer check must not silently discard this independent canonical open-origin source.

Fresh Task7 review MUST enumerate the full shared EARLY GATES chain, with source locations and real tests: (1) same-instance live non-human seat ordinal/high-water walk, page/continuation/budget limits; (2) `attention::seat_has_pending_rows` and actual indexed `WAKE_PROBES` inclusion of every canonical receipt-origin source, not just downstream predicates; (3) source publication/association, exact canonical author/instance attribution and remaining shared-condition lifetime; (4) bounded index-leading origin enumeration with SQL-enforced finite ordinal/high-water scope and honest inspection/continuation accounting, no full historical scan or first-event-only shortcut; (5) canonical attention pending-set narrowing, legacy/informational notice frontiers and independent open-origin selection; (6) candidate loading, current binding/occupant, actionable-work and offer-frontier gates; (7) canonical witness/freshness/reservation validation and native/mod admission. An origin source missing from ANY upstream exclusion invalidates the acceptance claim even if direct attention/reserve helpers pass. Task6's round1 rereview found exactly this gap at `seat_has_pending_rows`: direct downstream GREEN was not actual native discovery clearance.

Use isolated fake-host/test-support fixtures to verify draft/composer content, active working turn and unavailable host defer native key submission under the existing guards while the durable open warning and recoverable discovery/mod source remain present. After each blocker clears, the actual discovery→offer/load/reserve/native path must resume for the correct sender without recreating the canonical warning or losing another sender's origin. Do not interpret a blocked native submission as absent durable warning, remove native safety guards, or claim bounded key submission. Check exact canonical source associations, no synthetic ACK/adoption/completion, and existing receipt actor/generation/proof/history. Audit dynamic coalescing after informational settlement, partial ACK while another associated receipt remains, and final passive clear through the actual paths rather than only stored rows.

Preserve all settled Task7 requirements: one canonical shared condition/open event, origins derived from ALL exactly associated canonical messages (including departed senders), no individual quieting mandate after own ACK, same open condition while ANY required/pending/unwaived association remains, final single passive clear, and the full H/D/I upgrade-aware discovery bound/accounting/fairness contract. This is a tracked acceptance refinement on the existing owner, not a new leaf or responsibility transfer from Task6's invitation fix. Task7's implementation/reviewer must report every audited early gate and its actual path evidence explicitly before declaring sender notification complete.


### Concrete shared early-gate source admission

Coordinator explicitly admits `src/store/attention.rs` to Task7 writes: it owns `WAKE_PROBES`, `seat_has_pending_rows` and native/mod open-warning attention projection. The controller updates its cumulative mapping separately. No additional test paths are admitted; existing receipt/wake/wake-discovery/scheduler fixtures may suffice, and the implementer reports any actual additional need before writing. Task6’s invitation-origin index represents a single origin per invitation; a shared receipt warning condition can have multiple canonical message senders. Task7 must cover ALL those canonical senders through actual discovery and native/mod paths, without treating the first event source or a single invitation origin as the complete receipt audience. This admission imposes no architecture and creates no new implementation leaf. All preceding H/D/I, coalesced-condition partial/final settlement and full-discovery/early-gates requirements remain unchanged.


### Bounded projection bootstrap refinement (Task7)

Migration35 captures only indexed MAX physical receipt ordinal and raw sparse receipt_state rowid plus durable progress/completion; it performs no historical INSERT SELECT scan. Immediate canonical association/eligibility triggers cover new work. Bounded receipt-turn repair bootstraps historical open-origin associations and monotonic sparse due projections from genuine old rows. H includes ALL visits from Task5 physical/prepared deadline repair AND migration35 physical/sparse bootstrap; duplicate physical visits count again, as do terminal/future/waived/unpublished or otherwise ineffective rows actually visited. D and I include every actually traversed snapshot candidate, including future/lazy/non-due candidates whenever visited; neither means only warnings emitted or currently due rows.

All repair producers share the same at-most50 repair slots within the100 receipt-turn allowance. Unused quota and zero-row end probes lend within that same quantum; there is no hidden phase turn or second safety tick. The existing R=ceil(H/50)+2 conservative envelope is retained only with that measured full-allowance/end-probe proof. One combined global completion/reset occurs atomically only after ALL repair/bootstrap producers finish, before same-transaction ordinary due selection. Existing Task5 producer-local completion semantics remain intact; a local completion cannot prematurely consume the combined global reset. Failed decisions roll back progress, completion/reset and warning effects together. H=0 empty bookkeeping leaves the full100 ordinary slots in its first turn.

Fresh Task7 and integration review must prove genuine34→35 populated rollback/reopen, every preexisting eligible sparse obligation and associated open origin reconstructed without startup-wide scan, all visited work/lending/end probes, combined reset exactly once, all-terminal old backlog, continuing earlier-deadline arrivals, and deletion/reinsertion/rowid reuse during bootstrap. Triggers give newly eligible sparse candidates fresh monotonic ordinals; historical raw rowid reuse cannot lose obligations or rewrite canonical receipt/sender identity. Native wake admission remains independent. The conditional H/D/I bound and original H=0 formula remain unchanged, with expanded H honestly measured.

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Invitation contract

Ordinary agent invitations default to Lazy: membership is pending and discoverable through existing inbox/hook opportunities, but the invitation itself requests no timed confirmation or native wake. Add invitation `--require-ack` and optional `--deadline SECONDS`; explicit deadline implies require-ack for ergonomic compatibility, and `--lazy` conflicts with either. An ACK-required invitation starts its acceptance deadline at canonical invitation creation. Only explicit recipient acceptance settles it automatically; no separate invitation ACK command and no registration settlement. Expiry notifies its originating seat with invitation deadline missed, regardless of failure to register or accept. The inviter's open warning is waking attention under existing safe composer/host/mod guards even after leaving; clear remains passive and existing debtor/observer visibility remains. Originator attribution is frozen from the original invitation episode, never inferred from a current member or a later duplicate caller. Rejection/cancellation/retirement retain existing truthful terminal outcomes and attributed rejection notices; lazy does not suppress explicit rejection notices.

Existing required service memberships and explicit human/operator invitation semantics remain unchanged. Existing ordinary pending invitations retain their current timed obligation; historical retry with omitted new fields retains its original interpretation. Use an additive optional delivery/confirmation field whose absence denotes legacy timed behavior; modern CLI explicitly emits Lazy for the new default. Persist requested timing and original inviter attribution independently of joined membership. Pending-invite duplicate calls return the existing invitation without silently upgrading/downgrading its deadline or waking it; changing obligation policy requires a new episode through existing disposition flow. Already joined is still AlreadyJoined, never a new obligation. Existing human mode cannot manufacture an agent ACK requirement.

Queries, inbox compact/machine/JSON, digest, mod/native wake selection and due scans all honor the requested mode. Lazy presentation is bookkeeping only. ACK-required invitation attention remains ordinary guarded delivery; accept remains an accountable recipient choice. Add schema fields/index predicate changes conservatively and negotiate protocol capability/version before any mutation requiring the new representation. Older saved intent bytes/digests are preserved and replayed unchanged; unsupported daemon refuses new semantics before writing.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Write actual isolated CLI tests for bare lazy invite, --require-ack default duration, --deadline implies confirmation, --lazy conflict with either timed option, duplicate unchanged policy, historical keyed retry and unchanged required/operator commands.
2. Select explicit modern Lazy in ordinary invitation CLI by default; freeze requested mode/duration before journal submission and require the negotiated representation capability before writes. Preserve absent historical saved fields and old child digests.
3. Update compact/machine/JSON/inbox/help/embedded skill presentation to represent lazy versus timed invitations without claiming acceptance or registration receipt. Keep pending invitations discoverable while suppressing timed wake for lazy.
4. Run focused CLI/parser/output/skill tests and format/clippy; coordinate common docs with .3.2/.4.2 through serial merge rather than broad rewrites.

### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Stable hook entrypoints and ownership

Expose `herdr-threads hook-event HARNESS EVENT` as the dedicated stable CLI surface; map each declared native event exactly to its registered codec/handler. Keep existing `hook HARNESS --event EVENT` syntax working for old registrations. Reject invalid harness/event pairs before daemon effects. A given executable spelling plus canonical state-dir/host-endpoint plus harness/event yields byte-identical shell command across reinstalls. Routing selectors remain pinned where required; different installations/routes must not silently collapse.

Remove the per-install UUID shell comment from newly generated command strings, not the manifest installation identity. Persist exact installed groups/fingerprints and installation ID in ownership records. Existing unmanaged identical groups are foreign: do not adopt, overwrite, remove or treat them as owned without the existing explicit adoption path. Conflicting same-event registrations fail safely with actionable diagnostics. Reinstall reuses its existing exact owned group, retaining position to avoid unnecessary native trust-key shifts. Migrate legacy UUID-marked or shared-event owned groups only under explicit setup/doctor-fix intent, preserving unrelated groups/keys and interrupted-update recovery. Unsetup removes only exactly owned records; drift fails safely. No automatic edit of native trust records, hooks.state, or permission grants. Update status/trust reporting to compare each event's actual stable command rather than infer one shared string. Never silently rewrite real user configurations during development.

The Claude and Codex registrations get their declared per-event entrypoints. Hermes callback transport remains its existing fixed Python bridge; do not mechanically apply native shell grammar to it. Any bundled launch/mod prefix that currently consumes hook argv continues to obtain the canonical route rather than an event command. Registry manifests/canary expectations and embedded skill/help must agree with stable generated commands. TRUST-POLICY records invitation confirmation meaning and repaired receipt timer semantics; no new receipt provenance is needed for invitation acceptance.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Add isolated Claude/Codex ownership fixtures for equivalent repeat setup preserving group position, legacy UUID/shared-event owned migration, interrupted transition/recovery, foreign identical and drifted groups, safe unsetup and status/trust inspection.
2. Consume .4.1 exact per-event command grammar while retaining manifest installation identity, full exact owned groups/fingerprints and conservative foreign-group refusal. Migrate only under explicit setup/doctor-fix intent; preserve unrelated keys/group order and never edit native trust records/hooks.state.
3. Update shared-command consumers/status/trust/canary/launcher expectations to compare actual per-event commands or derive canonical route as appropriate. Keep Hermes transport and Claude mod launch route behavior unchanged. Publish owned-configuration fingerprint representation to .3.2 without weakening its safety.
4. Run focused setup/launch/mod/canary tests and format/clippy. All native configuration fixtures use isolated HOME/CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/CODEX_HOME; no real configs.

### Acceptance criteria (verbatim)

Implement and run every scenario named in this description; preserve the parent spec contract. Focused tests, format and per-change clippy pass. Observe durable overdue warning for an unregistered recipient (needs: ht-0lo.1.2). Require messages.send_time_receipts_v1 before new handoff effects; consume ht-0lo.1.1 capability contract and verify unsupported-daemon refusal before staging/launch.

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Durable handoff interface and recovery

Support exactly one instruction source: the legacy quoted positional body after `--`, `--file PATH`, or `--stdin`. Read once before any durable effect, require nonempty valid UTF-8 within 65,536 bytes, preserve exact content/newlines, bound input while reading, and freeze actual bytes into the compound intent. Retrying never rereads a file/stdin or native environment options. Keep topic/goal validation separate. Reuse src/cli/input.rs normal message source validation; body validation is nonempty valid UTF-8, not bounded_text's unrelated topic/identifier trim or NUL restrictions. The source bytes and their JSON escaping are preserved exactly. All three modes (new-tab, explicit empty-pane launch, existing-recipient delivery) use the same body/deadline contract and exact keys.

Handoff always sends an ACK-required addressed instructions message, defaulting to the existing receipt-duration setting; add `--deadline SECONDS` to override that message deadline, frozen before staging. Its invitation is lazy unless the caller explicitly requests `--require-invite-ack`; add `--invite-deadline SECONDS` to imply that option. Message and invitation deadlines are independent. Stage messages while invitation is pending; sender already joined is required. Carry policy through all public request, preparation, canonical bootstrap, legacy handoff, existing delivery and retained retry representations. Omitted new fields in historical intents preserve historical child requests/digests. No restaging of completed child mutations or automatic launch after possible-start.

Raise only body-bearing retained envelope ceilings conservatively: canonical bootstrap identity and request-bearing local bootstrap progress from128KiB to512KiB; recovery from256KiB to1MiB. Keep metadata-only creation/attachment128KiB, completed2MiB and global wire1MiB unless the actual serializer's supported worst-case fixtures demonstrate a required narrowly scoped adjustment. Six JSON bytes per input byte means a65,536-byte body consumes393,216 encoded bytes per occurrence; inventory every duplicated body and nested serialized original rather than assuming one occurrence. The handoff source task owns actual encoded-bound calculation/tests across public wire, canonical identity/recovery/completion, local progress/linked/terminal/origin snapshots and replay. Test maximum ordinary text, maximum six-byte-escaped UTF-8 body and source mutations through each public handoff path; all supported body values under ordinary bounded metadata must stage and survive retry. Exact serialized capacity checks occur before durable effects; independent oversized metadata/native response limits still fail honestly without truncation or reclassification. Update TRUST-POLICY encoded-limit documentation in the implementation commit and preserve historical bytes/keys/digests. No unconditional global frame increase or unbounded reads.

Native startup contains only fixed inbox instructions, exact canonical routing metadata and pinned fallback. It contains no task body, body path or arbitrary task argv. Compare all three routing fields before preferring hook commands. Existing launched agents with changing harness versions still recover instructions from durable inbox; setup diagnostics/trust refusals do not discard them. Hook/setup/profile readiness inspection is diagnostic and does not block staging or an otherwise safe guarded launch: observed hook installation/trust cannot establish delivery, and a wrong inherited profile must not veto launching a user-selected native harness. Retain exact empty-shell/seat/caller/native argv safety guards; fingerprint-recheck any owned launch configuration actually used, but absence of owned hook configuration is not a veto and never gets a fabricated fingerprint. Unsupported environment overrides and native host-kind/grammar capabilities remain safety refusals; native harness approval/configuration refusals remain truthful refusals, never automatically answered. ACK or overdue warning confirms the bounded handoff outcome, independent of advisory setup status. Launch success is not registration, acceptance, receipt or task adoption. On missed confirmation the sender inspects and recovers; trust/approval remains user consent, never automatic.

#### Message deadline contract

For every new durable ACK-required ordinary send, freeze the duration using existing validation/default configuration and set its original deadline to canonical committed send time plus that duration. This applies to every recipient, including no binding, managed-launch/unregistered binding, unavailable binding and pending invitation. Availability never changes the original start/deadline, and cannot reset it on registration, accept, restart, or rebind. Lazy messages and human receipt waivers remain free of ACK obligations. Receipt still means receipt only.

The effective receipt projection, manifest preparation, sparse physical materialization, due cursors, soft-poke calculations and wake paths must agree. Keep availability separately meaningful: setting a deadline is not permission to wake, nor evidence of a live harness. Do not pretend send time is observed availability. Existing structural/native execution launch guards and wake harness/empty-composer guards remain mandatory.

Upgrade outstanding pending ACK-required messages too: preserve every previously running deadline, but give formerly dormant obligations the deadline derived from their immutable message send time and frozen duration. Already expired rows become due on the normal bounded scan. Preserve terminal states, receipt provenance and warning identities. A transactionally recorded schema/semantics marker makes old and new manifest/physical projections consistent; materialize/index due work so unavailable recipients are actually discoverable, not merely capable of returning a deadline on individual lookup. Do not rewrite immutable requests or old result digests.

Existing explicit summary catch-up extensions in TRUST-POLICY A6 remain separate and visible; this redesign removes availability-based deferral, not the policy's bounded progress-based extension. Tests distinguish original deadline from an explicitly extended effective deadline. Warning delivery to the originating seat is durable even if it later leaves the thread; joined observers may retain existing warning visibility. An overdue warning says confirmation missed its deadline, never why. The original sender's open warning is waking attention under the existing composer/host/mod admission guards, even if the sender is no longer joined; clear remains passive and observer visibility is unchanged. For non-seat service authors preserve existing service reporting rather than inventing a sender seat. Update TRUST-POLICY A7 to record this narrow new waking recipient rule. Native wake can be deferred by a draft, active turn or unavailable host; the durable warning remains pending, so bounded deadline detection does not promise bounded native key submission. Late ACK clears the existing warning through normal lifecycle without retroactively changing the deadline.

#### Invitation contract

Ordinary agent invitations default to Lazy: membership is pending and discoverable through existing inbox/hook opportunities, but the invitation itself requests no timed confirmation or native wake. Add invitation `--require-ack` and optional `--deadline SECONDS`; explicit deadline implies require-ack for ergonomic compatibility, and `--lazy` conflicts with either. An ACK-required invitation starts its acceptance deadline at canonical invitation creation. Only explicit recipient acceptance settles it automatically; no separate invitation ACK command and no registration settlement. Expiry notifies its originating seat with invitation deadline missed, regardless of failure to register or accept. The inviter's open warning is waking attention under existing safe composer/host/mod guards even after leaving; clear remains passive and existing debtor/observer visibility remains. Originator attribution is frozen from the original invitation episode, never inferred from a current member or a later duplicate caller. Rejection/cancellation/retirement retain existing truthful terminal outcomes and attributed rejection notices; lazy does not suppress explicit rejection notices.

Existing required service memberships and explicit human/operator invitation semantics remain unchanged. Existing ordinary pending invitations retain their current timed obligation; historical retry with omitted new fields retains its original interpretation. Use an additive optional delivery/confirmation field whose absence denotes legacy timed behavior; modern CLI explicitly emits Lazy for the new default. Persist requested timing and original inviter attribution independently of joined membership. Pending-invite duplicate calls return the existing invitation without silently upgrading/downgrading its deadline or waking it; changing obligation policy requires a new episode through existing disposition flow. Already joined is still AlreadyJoined, never a new obligation. Existing human mode cannot manufacture an agent ACK requirement.

Queries, inbox compact/machine/JSON, digest, mod/native wake selection and due scans all honor the requested mode. Lazy presentation is bookkeeping only. ACK-required invitation attention remains ordinary guarded delivery; accept remains an accountable recipient choice. Add schema fields/index predicate changes conservatively and negotiate protocol capability/version before any mutation requiring the new representation. Older saved intent bytes/digests are preserved and replayed unchanged; unsupported daemon refuses new semantics before writing.

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Test actual new-tab, explicit empty-pane launch and existing-seat delivery with positional/file/stdin sources, frozen --deadline, lazy invite default and --require-invite-ack/--invite-deadline independence. Require messages.send_time_receipts_v1 and invitation representation capability before any new durable/native effects.
2. Carry frozen policy/body across public/preparation/canonical/legacy/existing/retained intent layers, preserving historical omitted fields and child digests. Exercise staged crash/retry, unknown-create and possible-start outcomes with no duplication/restaging/automatic relaunch.
3. Separate advisory hook/setup/trust/profile readiness diagnostics from launch admission. Retain caller/seat/empty-shell/native argv/host-kind/environment grammar guards and recheck actual owned launch configuration fingerprint only if used; absence is no veto and no fabricated fingerprint. Native trust refusal is truthful and never auto-approved.
4. Test missing/stale/wrong-profile hooks and unregistered recipient overdue sender warning with .1.2; verify exact three-field routing fallback and fixed startup argv, no auto acceptance/ACK/trust. Update help/skill/recovery docs and run focused handoff/launch/retry tests plus format/clippy.

### Acceptance criteria (verbatim)

Main handoff flows complete end to end with exact frozen bodies/routing and independent receipt/invitation deadlines. Overdue originators receive durable guarded waking attention; late confirmation clears passively. All owned native configurations and legacy retries remain safe. Final format, focused tests, all-feature clippy and default-feature gates pass; owned processes stopped. (needs: ht-0lo.1.1) (needs: ht-0lo.1.2) (needs: ht-0lo.1.3) (needs: ht-0lo.2.1) (needs: ht-0lo.2.2) (needs: ht-0lo.2.3) (needs: ht-0lo.3.1) (needs: ht-0lo.3.2) (needs: ht-0lo.4.1) (needs: ht-0lo.4.2)

### Global constraints (verbatim project instructions)

##### Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

###### Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

###### Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

###### Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.


### Normative parent contracts (verbatim)

#### Acceptance and validation

- Long instructions survive restart/retry unchanged; native argv excludes the body. Invalid, oversized, conflicting or unreadable sources fail before durable writes.
- New and previously dormant ACK obligations expire without recipient activity; already running deadlines do not move. Late registration/acceptance never restarts the clock. Due scans are bounded/indexed, sender receives warnings, late receipt clears normally.
- Lazy ordinary invitation produces no overdue/native wake; explicitly timed invitation warns the originator and acceptance settles automatically. No acceptance/ACK is synthesized by launch or registration.
- Equivalent reinstall emits identical per-event commands while foreign and drifted configuration survives; explicit legacy migration is recoverable and honest about native trust needing review.
- Existing bootstrap unknown-create/possible-start guarantees, human waivers, receipt provenance, required memberships, routing and hook trust boundaries continue passing their focused regression tests.
- Run cargo fmt, nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings and focused tests per change; before merge readiness also nice scripts/check-default-features. Use test-support-owned children/private Herdr sessions, stop all owned processes, and perform scoped leak checks after any full suite.

#### Non-goals and follow-on

No auto-trust, recipient auto-accept, task-adoption ACK, delivery exactly-once claim, automatic 1:1 thread selection, server restart, seat repair heuristics, real user config writes, deployment or merge into main. The parent run notifies its established main-tab discussion when the integration branch is ready for review/merge.

#### Confirmed roast refinements

Healthy-daemon discovery contract: retain the5,000ms safety tick and100candidate per-drive cap; continue immediately while successful due progress reports more. Each class advances a stable finite high-water cursor fairly; newly arriving obligations do not restart/starve the current snapshot. Native wake admission/completion never gates cursor progress. For a snapshot with at most N candidates per class and successful runnable driver quanta taking at most Q ms including storage/scheduling, durable pending-warning detection finishes within5,000ms +(2*ceil(N/100)+2)*Q; this is conditional on the daemon running and successful bounded storage, not a guarantee across outages, repeated errors, unbounded overload or native key submission. Restart resumes/reconstructs fair discovery and scans already overdue obligations. Early fake-clock tests use at least250candidates in EACH invitation and receipt class, blocked native wakes, mixed future/due rows, continuing arrivals and restart; verify every initial overdue row is warned within the formula and arrivals cannot starve either class. Historical upgrade also uses multiple bounded batches without losing overdue indexed discovery.

Receipt semantic capability: advertise messages.send_time_receipts_v1 only when canonical send-time projection and its ordinary send handlers are active. Modern clients require this capability before every new ACK-required ordinary send or handoff durable/native effect; absent/refused discovery produces explicit unsupported-daemon error, with no silent legacy fallback. All CLI entry paths and service-capable client sends that promise this contract are covered. Old clients talking to an upgraded daemon receive canonical new-send semantics without modifying their old wire requests. Lazy/human-waived sends remain exempt; completed retained keyed historical operations remain inspectable/replayable with original bytes/digests/outcomes and are never rewritten. A pending historical retry on an unsupported daemon refuses before additional effects. Test newCLI/olddaemon refusal, oldCLI/newdaemon canonical send, current/current unbound sends and lazy/human exemptions using capability fixtures.

### Coordinator execution contract

Coordinator ruling: ht-0lo.1.2 owns shared due driver/fair scheduling and combined fairness tests; ht-0lo.2.2 owns invitation-class cursor/store API/isolated tests. Preserve full requirements plus explicit cross-task seam and final sweep coverage. Final default-feature check is parent-owned after PR roast per explicit sequencing.

Read TRUST-POLICY.md before any protected source changes. Only implement declared ownership; mechanical compile-preserving adaptations are permitted. Report any additional write path before expanding filesTouched. Do not write root run-state/report/ledger from task worktrees. Test additions reuse existing module targets unless process-wide state requires a dedicated test target.

### TDD implementation and independently testable deliverable

1. Review final combined implementation against root and four subtree specs; identify uncovered interface cases and add focused isolated end-to-end tests for long durable inbox body, all delivery paths, receipt and invitation independent deadlines, originating-seat wake after leave, exact keyed retry and stable owned event configuration.
2. Run relevant focused tests on integration tip, cargo fmt and all-feature clippy, fix small remaining seam/docs inconsistencies inline; file larger blocker discoveries rather than concealing them. Preserve explicit process ownership and stop all private sessions/helpers. Export a fresh HT_LEAK_RUN_ID and run scripts/check-no-leaked-processes --run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID" after the integration sweep.
3. Parent coordinator owns readiness after PR roast: default-feature gate and any final expensive branch checks run once against the roast-cleared exact tip, with SHA evidence. This leaf supplies focused sweep evidence and does not falsely report the deferred gate as passed. No routine full suite under ht-zo4 restriction.
4. Return final implementation-seam test evidence and remaining blockers to parent. Parent owns report, roasts, final readiness, notify-main milestone and merge decision.

Terminal sweep also verifies expanded H and combined bootstrap completion from the Task7 bounded projection bootstrap refinement; no due-only or changed-row count may establish the global bound.

Task10 production seam admission: real canonical public handoff plus actual bounded materialization creates overdue warnings but lacks original-sender receipt_warning_origins. Native publication intentionally retains author_kind NULL; migration0002 explicitly defines NULL plus immutable actor seat as native. Exact migrations/0035_receipt_warning_origins.sql and src/store/receipts.rs admitted for all six maintained triggers and bounded historical projection to accept established native interpretation, with author_service_id absent, same-instance canonical actor seat, and exact published recipient association retained. tests/store/receipts.rs admitted for real ordinary-send positive, genuine historical NULL restart/backfill and service/built-in/unknown negative controls, alongside real public handoff RED. Do not rewrite immutable author history or synthesize fixture native kinds. TRUST wording clarifies existing provenance rather than inventing authority. Fresh Task10 review and explicit production/schema seam review must inspect original Task7 omission and narrow correction.

Exact tests/harness/adapter_smoke.rs admitted for mechanical Option adaptation in genuine configured-hook fixture; preserve original complete fingerprint assertions and run adapter smoke selection. Audit all explicit target consumers before rebuild. Mapped29363 compile-only uncovered missing fixture adaptation, not behavioral failure.
