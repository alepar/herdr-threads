# Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

## Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

## Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

## Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.
