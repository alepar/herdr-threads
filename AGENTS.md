# Agent guidelines for herdr-threads

## Development rules

- Per-change check: `nice cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` and `scripts/check-harness-neutral` (harness names stay out of the neutral core; allowlist `scripts/harness-neutral-allowlist.txt`; clippy already type-checks every target; a separate `cargo check` is redundant). Before a merge, also `nice scripts/check-default-features` (a default-feature `cargo check --all-targets` that fails on any warning; CI runs the full default-feature clippy job as well); format: `cargo fmt`.
- Commit trailer `Outside-adapter: <none | list>` (R13 accounting for the agy adapter epic): every commit names, in one trailer line placed with the other trailers, each changed path outside `src/harness/agy/` as a comma-separated list of repo-relative paths or globs, or `none`. The diff stays authoritative; the trailer only annotates it.
- Tests: run the tests relevant to your change (`nice cargo test --locked --all-features <filter>`); the full suite is `nice cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features` (cargo-nextest: one process per test, every binary in one pool; test groups in `.config/nextest.toml` keep the budget- and latency-sensitive chains one at a time; `nice scripts/full-suite-gate N` runs it N times in a row with leak checks, and `nice scripts/flake-hunt` hunts flaky tests). A test that must not overlap others of its kind gets a nextest test group, not only an in-binary mutex (a mutex does not span processes).
- Never restart, stop or kill the shared Herdr server, and never close Herdr workspaces/panes you did not create. Tests that need Herdr up/down use an isolated named Herdr test session (see `scripts/lib/isolated-herdr.sh`).
- Never write to the real user config: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.aisw`. Tests use isolated HOME / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR / CODEX_HOME under a temp dir.
- Never run `git push` or `git stash` (the stash stack is shared across worktrees). Commit on your own branch.
- A finished task stops its processes: every daemon, private Herdr server and helper process a test or script starts is stopped before the task reports done. Spawn test children with `herdr_threads::test_support::spawn` (`spawn_owned` / `command` / `tag`); never a bare `Command::spawn` in `tests/`.
- After a full-suite run (and after each run of the 10-run gate or the integration sweep), run `scripts/check-no-leaked-processes`. Export `HT_LEAK_RUN_ID=<uuid>` before the suite and pass `--run-id "$HT_LEAK_RUN_ID"` to it, so another worktree's live run is never flagged. A non-zero exit lists each leaked pid; stop them (or rerun with `--kill`) and fix the test that leaked them.
- Test targets are listed explicitly (`autotests = false`). A new suite that keeps no process-wide state goes into `tests/combined.rs` as a `#[path]` module (one binary, one link); a suite that redirects stdio, installs a panic hook, runs an in-process daemon, arms failpoints or changes the umask gets its own `[[test]]` entry. A target that uses `herdr_threads::test_support` (including `test_support::spawn`) needs `required-features = ["test-support"]`; otherwise `scripts/check-default-features` and the default-feature clippy job fail.
- The daemon's owner watch exists only in `test-support` builds: always test with `--all-features`.

## Trust policy

[TRUST-POLICY.md](TRUST-POLICY.md) is normative for seat continuity, caller attribution, receipt provenance
and operator repair. Read it before changing anything in `src/identity/`, `src/store/seats.rs`,
`src/store/receipts.rs`, `src/store/control.rs`, `src/protocol/authority.rs`, `src/cli/me.rs`,
`src/cli/hook.rs`, launch or wake.

- Do not add adversarial caller verification; the model is cooperative and same-user.
- Record claims honestly: a new way to attribute an action needs a provenance value defined in the policy.
- Never merge seats, never move a seat or end a binding on heuristic evidence.
- Decide in the daemon against the canonical view (A2); client-local files are hints, never authority.
- A change that weakens an invariant or adds an accepted limit updates TRUST-POLICY.md in the same commit.

## Harness-neutral core

- Harness-specific code lives only in `src/harness/<id>/` behind `HarnessAdapter` and its policy traits. Core code looks the adapter up through the registry by the id from the binding or claim.
- New harness behaviour means a new trait method or policy with a neutral default, never a branch in core.
- Core is `src/cli`, `src/client`, `src/service`, `src/daemon`, `src/store`, `src/host`, `src/protocol`, `src/app` and the neutral `src/harness/*.rs` files. Adapter-owned paths are `src/harness/<id>.rs`, `src/harness/<id>/**` and `src/harness/<id>_*.rs` for the ids in `builtins()`.
- `scripts/check-harness-neutral` enforces this, with `scripts/harness-neutral-allowlist.txt` as the exception list. Permanent entries are only frozen wire shapes, historical migrations and registration. See "Development rules" for how to run the checks.

## Delivery contract

The goal is token efficiency. Sessions that are done and idle stay idle, spinning sessions get efficient delivery, and nudges are rare, because excessive nudges disorient some models. Every delivery policy must keep these invariants:

1. Messages are lazy by default.
2. Lazy messages never wake an idle session (unless the seat opted into `wake_on: all`).
3. Turn hooks and channels deliver every pending item, lazy or not, directly into the model's context, avoiding extra `herdr-threads` calls as far as the harness allows.
4. A nudge wakes a session only when it is idle. A session that is generating, or running a tool, gets no nudge; it is served by in-turn delivery.
5. Messages that require an ACK are always nudge-class.
6. Who performs an idle wake is the only per-harness variation:
   - `Native`: Herdr types the wake marker into an empty composer;
   - `Channel`: the harness wakes itself, as Claude's mod submits a turn.

Every new delivery policy (`DeliveryPolicy`) and every change to wake, poke or check-in delivery is checked against these rules; the 2026-10 audit is in `docs/superpowers/runs/2026-10-09-agy-harness-adapter/delivery-contract-audit.md`.

## Speed budgets

- The full test suite must stay under **5 minutes** wall-clock (`cargo nextest run --locked --all-targets --all-features`). Treat a regression past it as a bug: fix slow or serialized tests rather than raising the budget.
- An incremental build must stay under **1 minute** (edit one source file, then `cargo build` / `cargo test --no-run`), and so must the per-change lint (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`).
- Until the flakiness side quest (ht-zo4) lands, do not run the full suite routinely; run focused tests for what you changed.
